           Rob joined the Tao Research Group in Spring 2014 as a post doctoral researcher after completing his Ph.D. studies in Chemistry at SMU in the CATCO group working with Dr. Kraka and Dr. Cremer. He received his B.S. in Chemical Engineering in 2006 from Texas Tech Univeristy and his M.S. in Chemistry in 2009 from the University of Texas at Dallas. Robâ€™s computational research has spanned multiple size and time scales ranging from continuous fluid dynamics to course-grained and atomistic molecular dynamics to quantum mechanics based simulations. He uses rigid body methods to study allostery and direct path simulations to study reaction mechanisms in biological systems. <br>

        Ashleigh is currently an undergraduate student majoring in Biology. She joined the lab in the Fall of 2013 and is currently working with Camille Biard on the computational analysis of the chemiluminescence of 1,2-dioxetanes. When not working, she enjoys watching Star Trek and being outdoors. She aspires to eventually earn a PhD and incorporate her love for physics and programming into research on the effects of microbial systems on the planet.
