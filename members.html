          <br>

          Francesco obtained his Bachelor's degree in Chemistry at Alma Mater Studiorum, University of Bologna, Italy. Due to his fascination for (Bio)-Organic Chemistry and his passion for Computational Chemistry, maturated during his undergraduate research project about the optimization of LYS@C60 binding through in silico mutagenesis, he decided to pursue the study of Computational Chemistry applied to bio-molecular systems with a Research Master in Drug Discovery with a specialization in Computational Medicinal Chemistry and Toxicology at Vrije Universiteit of Amsterdam, the Netherlands. In Amsterdam, he grew a scientific interest in the computational prediction of protein allostery, which brought him at SMU to work under Dr. Tao supervision as Ph.D. student. Food and wine enthusiast, loves to spend his free time cooking and listening to music. Undercover death metal and anime lover.
